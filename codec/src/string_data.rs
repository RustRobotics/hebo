/// Text fields within the MQTT Control Packets described later are encoded as UTF-8 strings.
/// UTF-8 [RFC3629] is an efficient encoding of Unicode [Unicode] characters that
/// optimizes the encoding of ASCII characters in support of text-based communications.
///
/// String Data is represented by a Two Byte Integer length which indicates
/// the number of data bytes, followed by characters.
///
/// Thus, the length of String Data is limited to the range of 0 to 65,535 Bytes.
///
/// ```text
/// +-------------------+
/// | String Length     |

///
/// The character data in a UTF-8 Encoded String MUST be well-formed UTF-8 as defined
/// by the Unicode specification [Unicode] and restated in RFC 3629 [RFC3629].
/// In particular, the character data MUST NOT include encodings of code points
/// between U+D800 and U+DFFF [MQTT-1.5.4-1].
///
/// If the Client or Server receives an MQTT Control Packet containing ill-formed UTF-8
/// it is a Malformed Packet.
///
/// A UTF-8 Encoded String MUST NOT include an encoding of the null character U+0000. [MQTT-1.5.4-2].
///
/// If a receiver (Server or Client) receives an MQTT Control Packet containing U+0000
/// it is a Malformed Packet.
///
/// The data SHOULD NOT include encodings of the Unicode [Unicode] code points listed below.
/// If a receiver (Server or Client) receives an MQTT Control Packet containing any of them
/// it MAY treat it as a Malformed Packet. These are the Disallowed Unicode code points.
///
/// - U+0001..U+001F control characters
/// - U+007F..U+009F control characters
/// - Code points defined in the Unicode specification [Unicode] to be non-characters (for example U+0FFFF)
///
/// A UTF-8 encoded sequence 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF is always interpreted as U+FEFF ("ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE")
/// wherever it appears in a string and MUST NOT be skipped over or stripped off
/// by a packet receiver [MQTT-1.5.4-3].
